# Digit-Recognition

## Objective: To Train a Neural Network with one Hidden Layer using Back-Propogation Algorithm Such that it is capable of recognition Handwritten Digits.  

We have used MNSIT Handwritten digit dataset `mnsit_all.mat` that contains 60K training and 10K testing examples of handwritten digits. Each example in the dataset is represented ny 784 features corroponding to (28 * 28) pixel values ([0,255]). The classes are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 corresponding to each digit.<br/>
